# OOP-project

The project of the OOP class (Object-Oriented Programming).

The goal of the project was to create an interface to manage a Warehouse, where you had partners, products, transactions, etc.
You could interact with the Manager via the command line.

The project was written in Java and explored concepts like Design Patterns, code organization, and Java classes.

# How to run

To run the Warehouse Manager, run the script `runEverything.sh` inside the `project` folder.  

ATTENTION: The project cannot be run anymore because it imported files made available by the Teacher (in a CVS repository) that are not available anymore.
